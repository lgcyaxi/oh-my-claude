# v1.1.3

Release date: 2026-01-16

## Fixed

### Installer Path Resolution
- Fixed commands not being installed when running via `npx`
- Fixed hooks, MCP server, and statusline not being installed
- Replaced unreliable `__dirname` with `import.meta.url` for correct path resolution in bundled code
- Added better error messages when source directories are not found

### Debug Mode
- Added `DEBUG_INSTALL=1` environment variable to enable verbose installation logging
- Helps troubleshoot installation issues by showing path resolution details

## Files Changed
- `src/installer/index.ts` - Fixed `getPackageRoot()` to use `import.meta.url` instead of `__dirname`

## Upgrade Instructions
If you previously had a broken installation, run:
```bash
npx @lgcyaxi/oh-my-claude@1.1.3 install --force
```
